# Memory-game
Project based on a tutorial of wonderfull [@kubowania](https://github.com/kubowania)
( btw I love Ania's [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) !).

A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. There are so many versions of it it is hard to in down it's exact origin. There are claims that the famuos writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain invented his own version. I googled it and whatever it is, it looks more like a way of trying to figure out how much tax you owe rather than match cards.

## Rules of Memory Game
- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score
- These cards then disspear
- If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of ths and the cards flip back
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board

## Styling
As the original project had very little styling, I allowed myself to inspire my memory game by "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" tv series. I made all the cards in Canva. The font is "Font Diner" also used in the series-opening credits.

## What I learned?
- for loops
- addEventListener
- setAttribute
- getAttribute
- data-name
- document.querySelector
- createElement
